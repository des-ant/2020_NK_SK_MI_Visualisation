            North Korea and South Korea started out as poor nations after World War II. Today South Korea’s economy and standard of living rank amongst the highest in the world whereas North Korea remains at the bottom of the world’s development ladder (Ellington
            & Ferrarini, 2017). Due to the secrecy of the North Korean government, its economic data is limited and unreliable (Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017).

            <p>
              The division of Korea began at the end of World War II in 1945 with the occupation of Korea by the Allied forces that defeated Japan (Lee, 2006). The Soviet troops took over Korea north of the 38th parallel and the US troops occupied the regions south
              of this dividing line (Lee, 2006; Nash, 2008).

                In 1948, the 38th parallel became the boundary between Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), led by Kim Il-sung and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) led by Syngman Rhee (Lee, 2006; Nash, 2008).

              In 1950, after years of mutual hostility, the North Korea Army crossed the parallel and invaded South Korea in an attempt to re-unify the peninsula under its communist rule (Lee, 2006; Nash, 2008). The subsequent Korean War ended in 1953 with a stalemate,
              establishing the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separated North and South Korea up to the present day (Lee, 2006; Nash, 2008).

            <p>
              In the decade after the Korean War, South Korea struggled to climb up the world’s development ladder (Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017). Disgusted by the dysfunctional economy and the Rhee administration’s corruption, a student-led revolution ousted Rhee,
              leading to a new “democratic” constitution and government (Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017).

              Economic conditions did not improve and the government was overthrown in 1961 by General Park Chung-hee’s military coup d’état (Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017).

              In the 1960s, international trade played a key role in South Korea’s rapidly expanding economy, earning the title of “Asian tiger” (Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017). The Park regime abandoned import substitution policies, permitting the importation of goods,
              services and resources that were otherwise in short supply (Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017). South Korea was also producing and exporting garments, textiles, shipbuilding, electronics, chemicals, metal, and iron (Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017).

              The chaebol, meaning “rich family” in Korean, were family-run conglomerates financed by the government as a way to fast-track economic development (Pae, 2019). Five of these companies (LG, Hyundai, SK, Lotte, Samsung) now own half of the South Korean
              market share.

            In the 1980s, deregulation in trade and financial sectors drove focus away from chaebol industries, and led to less central government involvement allowing more business diversification (Shin, as cited in Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017). The economy rebounded
            and South Korea emerged as a world leader in the high tech industry (Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017).

              North Korea outperformed South Korea for eight years after the Korean war. (Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017). With access to mineral resources, and aid from China and the Soviet Union, the highly rigid dictatorship of the North was able to grow the economy
              (Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017).

              Since 1948, the North Korean regime has adhered to a centrally planned economic system and the doctrine of Juche, meaning self-reliance (Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017). For the past few decades, the regime has prioritised military spending and aggressively
              developing nuclear weapons and missiles (McCafferty, as cited in Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017).

              The North Korean economy is tightly controlled by its government, with production and international trade strictly limited to that permitted by the government and denied to the general populace (Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017).

              In the early 1990s, the fall of the Soviet Union, the reduction in aid and exports from China, and long term central planning mistakes led to economic recession (Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017). This resulted in a man-made famine that killed up to one million
              people (West & Johnson, as cited in Ellington & Ferrarini, 2017).

              Despite sharing a common culture throughout most of history, North and South Korea provide vastly different living standards today. Both countries continue to face challenges. However, people in South Korea benefit from a democratic government, a market economy and their major role in the global economy. Unless the North Korean institutions change, it seems that the majority of its people will continue to live in poverty, uncertainty and isolation from the rest of the world.
